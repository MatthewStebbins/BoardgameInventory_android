# AdMob Troubleshooting Steps

## Current Status
- AdMob SDK 22.6.0 is included in dependencies
- Test ad unit ID is configured: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111
- ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission is added
- Ad layouts are properly included in all activities

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Network Connection
The app needs internet connection for ads to load.

### 2. Verify Test Device Configuration
In debug builds, test device IDs should be configured.

### 3. Check Logcat Output
Look for these log messages:
- "AdMob initialized"
- "Ad loaded successfully" 
- "Ad failed to load" with error details

### 4. Common Issues
- AdMob initialization timing
- Network connectivity
- Test device configuration
- Ad unit ID configuration
- Layout visibility issues

## Quick Test
1. Launch the app
2. Go to MainActivity 
3. Check if ad banner space is visible at bottom
4. Look for log messages indicating ad loading status

## Next Steps
- Add more detailed logging
- Test with a simple standalone AdView
- Verify AdMob account configuration
