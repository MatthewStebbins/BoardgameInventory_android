# Fix AdMob by Restarting Emulator with Google Play Services

## The Problem
Your emulator likely doesn't have Google Play Services properly configured, which is why AdMob is stuck loading (yellow strip forever). This is very common with Android emulators.

## Solution: Restart Emulator with Google Play Services

### Step 1: Close Current Emulator
1. Close the current emulator completely
2. In Android Studio, go to **Tools > AVD Manager**

### Step 2: Check Your Current AVD
Look for your Pixel 3a API 34 emulator and check:
- **Target**: Should say "Google APIs" or "Google Play" 
- **Play Store**: Should show a Play Store icon ‚úì

### Step 3A: If Your AVD Has "Google Play" - Just Restart
1. Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (Start) button to restart the emulator
2. Wait for it to fully boot
3. **Important**: Open Google Play Store app on emulator to verify it works
4. If Play Store opens successfully, Google Play Services should work

### Step 3B: If Your AVD Says "Google APIs" (No Play Store)
You need to create a new AVD with Google Play:
1. Click "Create Virtual Device"
2. Select **Pixel 3a** 
3. Click **Next**
4. Choose **API 34** but look for one that says **"Google Play"** (not just "Google APIs")
5. Download if needed, then click **Next**
6. Name it "Pixel_3a_API_34_GooglePlay"
7. Click **Finish**
8. Start this new emulator

### Step 4: Verify Google Play Services
Once emulator is running:
1. Open **Google Play Store** app
2. Sign in with a Google account (any account works)
3. Try searching for any app to confirm it's working
4. If Play Store works, Google Play Services are available

### Step 5: Test Our App
1. Launch BoardGame Inventory app
2. You should now see:
   - Red strip: "AD CONTAINER TEST"
   - Yellow strip that quickly changes to Green (success) or Orange (error with details)

## Why This Happens
- AdMob requires Google Play Services to function
- Many emulator configurations don't include proper Play Services
- "Google APIs" ‚â† "Google Play" - you need the full Play Store version

## Expected Result
After restarting with proper Google Play Services:
- Yellow strip ‚Üí Green = Ads working! üéâ
- Yellow strip ‚Üí Orange = Ad error (but at least we get error details)

Try this first - it's much better than mocking since you'll have real AdMob functionality!
