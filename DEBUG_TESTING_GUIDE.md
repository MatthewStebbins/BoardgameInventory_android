# AdMob Debug Testing - Next Steps

## What We've Added:
1. **Comprehensive logging** for every step of ad loading
2. **Visual feedback** - background colors change based on ad status:
   - Yellow = AdView found, trying to load
   - Orange = Ad failed to load (with error details)
   - Green = Ad loaded successfully
3. **Google Play Services check** - verifies if the emulator can use AdMob
4. **Detailed error reporting** - shows exact error codes and messages

## Testing Instructions:

### 1. Launch the App
Open the BoardGame Inventory app and go to MainActivity.

### 2. What to Observe:
- **Red strip**: "AD CONTAINER TEST" (should still be visible)
- **Yellow/Orange/Green strip**: AdView area - color indicates status
- **Background color changes**:
  - Stays yellow = still trying to load
  - Changes to orange = ad failed to load
  - Changes to green = ad loaded successfully

### 3. Check for Error Messages:
If available, look in Android Studio Logcat for these key messages:

**Successful flow:**
```
D/AdManager: === AdManager.initialize() called ===
D/AdManager: Google Play Services are available âœ“
D/AdManager: === loadAdInternal() called ===
D/MainActivity: *** AD LOADED SUCCESSFULLY! ***
```

**Failed flow:**
```
E/AdManager: Google Play Services NOT available! Error code: [number]
E/MainActivity: Ad failed to load!
E/MainActivity: Error code: [number]
E/MainActivity: Error message: [description]
```

### 4. Common Issues and Quick Fixes:

**If yellow strip turns orange (ad failed):**
- This is normal and gives us the error details
- Common errors: "No fill", "Network error", "Invalid ad unit"

**If strip stays yellow (loading forever):**
- Google Play Services issue
- Network connectivity problem
- AdMob service unavailable

**If strip turns green:**
- Success! Ads are working properly
- Should see actual ad content appear

## Next Step:
**Launch the app and tell me what color the bottom strip turns to**, and if possible, share any error messages you see in the logs.

This will tell us exactly what's preventing the ads from loading!
