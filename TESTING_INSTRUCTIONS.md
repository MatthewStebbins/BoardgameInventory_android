# AdMob Testing Instructions

## What We've Added for Debugging

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logs to track AdMob initialization and ad loading
2. **Visual Indicators**: Added colored backgrounds to help identify ad spaces:
   - Yellow background: AdView is found and configured
   - Red background: Ad container exists but AdView is missing
3. **Network Check**: Added network connectivity verification
4. **Timing Fix**: Added delay for AdMob initialization

## Testing Steps

1. **Launch the App**: Open the BoardGame Inventory app
2. **Check Bottom of Screen**: Look for colored areas at the bottom of MainActivity
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - You should see a yellow strip at the bottom if ads are working
   - You should see a red strip if the container exists but ads aren't loading
   - If you see neither, there's a layout issue

## What to Look For

### Visual Indicators:
- **Yellow background**: AdView is present and being configured
- **Red background**: Ad container found but no AdView
- **Test ads**: Should show "Test Ad" banner if AdMob is working
- **Real content**: The ad space should show actual ad content

### In Device Logs (if accessible):
Look for these messages:
- "AdMob initialized"
- "Ad loaded successfully" 
- "Ad failed to load" with error details
- "Network connected: true/false"

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **No colored background visible**: Layout might not be including the ad banner
2. **Red background only**: AdView XML configuration issue
3. **Yellow background but no ads**: Network or AdMob configuration issue
4. **Ads show briefly then disappear**: Ad loading error

## Next Steps

If you still don't see any ads or colored backgrounds:
1. Take a screenshot of the main screen
2. Let me know what you observe at the bottom
3. I can add even more debugging or try a different approach

The app should now be much more verbose about what's happening with ads!
